# Authentication Fix Documentation

## Summary of Changes

1. **Reinstalled all dependencies with pnpm**
   - Removed existing node_modules and lock files
   - Migrated from npm to pnpm for package management
   - Installed the latest versions of all dependencies

2. **Updated Supabase Authentication**
   - Added `@supabase/ssr` package (the recommended replacement for the deprecated `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`)
   - Updated middleware.ts to use the new authentication approach
   - Updated auth-context.tsx to use the new browser client
   - Enhanced the login redirect mechanism

## How to Test

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Try logging in at http://localhost:3000/admin
   - The login should redirect to the dashboard now
   - If you manually navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard, it should also work

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Type Errors

If you encounter type errors relating to Supabase packages:

```sh
pnpm add @types/supabase
```

### Redirect Still Not Working

If you still experience redirect issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any errors in authentication or token issues
2. **Clear Browser Cache/Cookies**: Authentication tokens might be stored incorrectly
3. **Check Network Tab**: Look for any failed requests during login
4. **Try Private/Incognito Mode**: This eliminates cached data interference

### Package Conflicts

If you encounter package conflicts:

```sh
pnpm store prune  # Clean up pnpm store
pnpm install      # Reinstall dependencies
```

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing server-side authentication routes using Next.js API routes
2. Improve error handling for authentication edge cases
3. Add comprehensive authentication state logging for debugging
